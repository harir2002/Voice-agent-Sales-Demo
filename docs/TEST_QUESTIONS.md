# 🧪 TESTING TIPS

## Best Practices for Testing

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic questions before moving to complex ones
2. **Test Both Languages**: Ensure the agent handles code-switching (mixing English and Hindi)
3. **Check Context Retention**: Ask follow-up questions to test memory
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Ask questions not in the knowledge base to test fallback responses
5. **Verify Accuracy**: Match responses against the knowledge base content
6. **Test Interruptions**: Try interrupting the agent mid-response
7. **Test Escalation**: Ask to speak to a human agent

## Sample Edge Case Questions

### English
- "I want to know about something not related to this" (Out of scope)
- "Can you transfer me to a human?" (Escalation)
- "What's the weather today?" (Off-topic)

### Hinglish  
- "Yeh toh mujhe samajh nahi aaya, kuch aur batao" (Confusion handling)
- "Main insaan se baat karna chahta hoon" (Human handoff)
- "Aaj mausam kaisa hai?" (Off-topic)
